## üîß Steps Involved

### 1. Problem Identification
- Identified key repetitive SOC tasks:
  - Log analysis and filtering.
  - Triggering alerts based on predefined threat indicators.
  - False positive triaging.
  - Incident escalation workflows.

### 2. Tool Selection
- Selected the SOAR platform for automation (e.g., Splunk Phantom).
- Chose Python for custom scripting and APIs.
- Integrated with SIEM tools for log management and threat detection.

### 3. Workflow Design
- Designed automated workflows for:
  - Log ingestion and filtering.
  - Alert correlation from SIEM to reduce noise.
  - Automated threat intelligence enrichment (VirusTotal).
  - Incident ticket creation in ServiceNow based on severity.

### 4. Scripting & API Integration
- Created Python scripts for:
  - API calls to integrate security tools.
  - Parsing logs and threat intelligence feeds.
  - Automating report generation.
- Used APIs from tools like Splunk, VirusTotal, and CrowdStrike.

### 5. Implementation
- Deployed scripts and workflows on the SOAR platform.
- Integrated threat intelligence feeds and EDR solutions with SOAR.
- Linked the SIEM tool to trigger automated responses for high-priority alerts.

### 6. Testing & Tuning
- Tested automated workflows in a sandbox environment.
- Tuned SIEM rules and scripts to reduce false positives and improve accuracy.
- Monitored for performance issues or unexpected behavior.

### 7. Deployment & Monitoring
- Deployed the automation in the live SOC environment.
- Monitored automation performance to ensure incident escalation works properly.
- Gathered metrics on improvements in response times and reduction in manual work.
---
## üìä Outcome
- **70% reduction in false positive alerts**, allowing analysts to focus on real threats.
- **50% improvement in incident response times** due to automated escalation.
- Enhanced SOC efficiency and improved collaboration through automated workflows.
